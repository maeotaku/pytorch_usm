A Unsharp Masking (USM) layer implementation for PyTorch. The layer allows to make the preprocessing stage of the image part of the network itself. It optimizes the sigma and lambda of the USM and LoG filters/layers. This new approach attempts to preprocess images during the model training.

Paper about this to be released soon.
